> Yet another peer-to-peer encrypted file transfer utilizing native Node.js Streams, Crypto, and HTTP with absolutely no dependencies, for the most effective and stealthy operation possible.

## WHY 🤬!?

`Why the #*&@!? do we need this?` If you have [RSYNC](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync), [SCP](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/scp.1.html),
or any of the other fantastic secure file transfer tools **YOU DO NOT NEED THIS, TURN AWAY NOW**. If however, you are in
a locked down environment, and just need to get some files off one system to another, and you have NodeJS installed,
then this might be what you are looking for... (**_DID I MENTION, WITH ABSOLUTELY, NO DEPENDENCIES_**). You can
literally, copy the code from the `dist/` ( you have two options compressed and not compressed ) directory into a
file on your local machine, and run it. It will work on any platform that NodeJS supports 🎉.

**Disclaimer** this has not been tested on anything other than Linux and MacOS with Node 16, I suspect the GLOB's will not work on a PC

## How does this work? ( TL;DR ) 🧐

Simply put, it uses the following Node.js libraries: `cluster`, `cluster`, `fs`, `http`, `path`, `stream`, and `url`.
All to create a cluster of HTTP servers (one to control traffic) that are capable of accepting an encrypted compressed
stream of data from a client (💥 you're done!).

## Ports and Proxies 🚧

You might wonder why I use HTTP and port 3000. This is the most ubiquitous protocol with the most commonly used port and
is capable of penetrating firewalls without being flagged by UTMs or any other policy enforcement tools.

If you find that it doesn't work properly through a proxy, raise a PR, and I will fix it. I have tested it through a
proxy.
